## 🏡 Nashville Housing Data Cleaning  

### 🔗 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/your-github/Nashville-Housing-Cleaning)  

### 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **cleaning and transforming** real estate data from Nashville using **SQL (Snowflake)**. The goal was to turn messy raw data into a structured, analysis-ready dataset.  

### 🔍 Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved renaming columns for consistency, removing duplicates to prevent double-counting, and handling missing values strategically. Missing owner_name entries were filled with 'Unknown', while median values were used to impute missing year_built, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Additionally, land_value and building_value were adjusted using the median per tax district. Address fields were standardized by separating city and street, and dates were formatted for improved readability.

### 🛠 Skills Used  
✅ **SQL (Snowflake)** – Data transformation & querying  
✅ **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing data, duplicates, and inconsistencies  
✅ **Data Standardization** – Ensuring uniform formatting  
✅ **Using Window Functions** – For deduplication and imputation
