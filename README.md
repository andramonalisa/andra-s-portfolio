## 🏡 Nashville Housing Data Cleaning  

### 🔗 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/andramonalisa/nashville-housing-data-cleaning)  

### 📌 Overview  
The data cleaning process involved renaming columns for consistency, removing duplicates to prevent double-counting, and handling missing values strategically. Missing owner_name entries were filled with 'Unknown', while median values were used to impute missing year_built, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Additionally, land_value and building_value were adjusted using the median per tax district. Address fields were standardized by separating city and street, and dates were formatted for improved readability.
